Let's formalize a little: the action of creating a new procedure is known as **definition** or **declaration**, and that leads us to introduce new syntactic elements (meaning, things that we can write in our program):

- the reserved word `procedure`, indicates that we will define a new element;
- a name which represents what our procedure will do, which **must always start with capital letters**. Something important: **the brackets of the end are necessary**, we will see why later on;
- a code block, which will be what is executed every time we invoke our procedure. This block starts with an opening brace (`{`) and ends with closing one (`}`), similar to what we already did for the `program`.

> Let's see if you got it: write a procedure Drop3Red which drops 3 red stones and a program which uses it.
