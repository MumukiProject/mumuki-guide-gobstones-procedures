Something _VERY_ important is that a procedure is defined **only once** and then can be **used** every time you may need it, as any other command.

Thus, its name must be **unique** within the entire program (you already know that the computer only follows orders and, in the event there was more that one procedure with the same name, it wouldn't know which to follow).

In order to make things easier for you, from now on (but not always) we will offer to you some parts of the solution of the problem, so you will only focus on what we want you to do.
Sometimes you will be able to see that code in the tab **Library**, and sometimes we will let you know it in the instructions or in the “help”…pay attention!

> Write a **program** which drops 9 green stones in the current cell, using the procedure “Drop3Green” that you previously created.
