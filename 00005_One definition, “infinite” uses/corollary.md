In conclusion, in relation to a procedure, two moments may be distinguished:

* the **definition**, which is related to the moment when we write `procedure Drop3Green()` and the code block which specifies what it does.This is done just once during all the program (and it will fail if you try to do it twice, since names can't be repeated);
* the **use** or **invoking**, which is when we write `Drop3Green()` in some part of our problem or in other procedure, any time you need it!
