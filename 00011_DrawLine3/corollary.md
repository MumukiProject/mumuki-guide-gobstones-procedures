We could have written “c”, “col” or even “tom” instead of “color”, since the computer doesn't care about the name we give to things…but we do (and a lot), so that is why we chose to **use names that express in a proper manner what we want to say**.

Also, pay attention to the fact that we chose to **change the name to the procedure**, because now it works for any color. Again, this not strictly necessary for the computer, but it is highly important to those humans beings who will read and write the code. Imagine if we left the same name! Then, when using the procedure, it would be DrawBlackLine3(Red) and it is not clear what it does (a red line? a black one? a red and black line?).

Conclusion: **learn to choose proper names is essential to a good programming**.
