In contrast with the previous guide, where we only used commands that came with the language (Gobstones), you will learn to **create your own commands** with this lesson.And that is the most beautiful thing of programming: being able to invent your own tasks in order to solve the problems.

This powerful tool will let us **reuse more code** since, when using a **procedure**, we will be able to “configure” it in order for it to work in the way we need in the moment we want (for example, choosing an address, a color or a number).

One more thing: when using variables, remember that the order and the number do matter (and the name too, although it is not important for the computer).
