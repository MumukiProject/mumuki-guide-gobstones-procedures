As we explained in the square example, we can start making differences between two types of commands inside a program:

- those that **are defined by the language** and are useful to express basic operations, such as `Move`, `Drop` and `Grab`. We call them **primitive commands**, or simply **primitive**;
- and those that **are defined by ourselves**, which are useful to express more complex tasks. Like the name of this lesson suggests, these are the **procedures**.

When creating a procedure, we “teach” the computer to carry out a new task, which wasn't originally included in the language.

It would be impossible to write a language that includes EVERYTHING that we may want to do, wouldn't it?

> Now it's your turn: write a procedure `Drop3Green` which drops 3 green stones in the **current cell** and a `program` which uses it.
